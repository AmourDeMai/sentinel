Curtis Painter's finally going to get a shot tonight. I can't help but root for that guy!
I've got a blog post coming up tomorrow. Topic? It's time to learn once and for all what Curtis Painter's got. Start the man. #Colts
@VH1 We're so happy AdamBehindTheMusic trended in the US & worldwide tonight!! Thanks so much for showcasing Adam on this special!
Peyton Manning ......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! If Curtis Painter is starting on Sunday, I am going to lose my shit.
Big night. Going to watch the Cards thrash the Pirates for a bit and then the 2011 @nyjets debut on MNF. #CANTWAIT
#TeamPatiots we play tonight vs. dem clowns from Tampa Bay catch da full game on NFL NETWORK AT 11
Since I'm a Redneck I'm gonna pull up to the Heritage game Friday blaring some Hank Williams with my cowboy hat and blue jeans #yeahbuddy
@Plain_Pete yah I know it's on. But it keeps saying Monday night football and says MNF on the scoreboard. I'm just confused bc it's Thursday
on the bright side DWTS cast cumin Mon. my girl Kym better b on &hav sum1 that she has a chance 2 win again! go Kym ! ;-)
It's going to be a somber set tonight for Curtis Painter's Nickelback cover band, Something In Your Mouth.
@HillMcGill does hank williams jr sing the song for monday night rugby, too?
@FINALLEVEL RT Coco may be on the next season of DWTS. If she makes it, I'll watch the 1st episode. How about you? 407.916.1041 @SBKLIVE
Where's a good place in Studio City/LA to watch Monday Night Football tonight? Lemme know!
colts game was fun tonight. love spending time with my fam.
TONITE IT GOES DOWN!!! STREET FM on 90.1FM in NY Broadcasting worldwide at www.wusb.fm OR watch inside the studio at www.justin.tv/streetfm
#GoTexans v. the dirty #Jets football team on MNF tonight -
so Verlander is starting tomorrow against the Indians and I HAVE to stay over at work. booooooo
Weird music mood today . Lots of Hank Williams and Johnny Cash running through the iphone.
Worcestershire? What are you on about? Still coming down from your 1st half high? Worldwide fanbase is something #mcfc don't have! #MUFC
Man,I want to go fuxs with the homies @Hdashkane @ADdaCAPO @KEN2theFOOL tonite for MNF @ the #Horn but I can't:(
Going to predict that Curtis Painter "gets it" this season, throws for 24TD and 3400 yards. #Colts trade him for a 2nd round pick. #sarcasm
Watch Monday Night Football tonight (& pre-game festivities) on ESPN. I'm in the intro with Hank Williams Jr. Starts at 6pm EST. I will..
@MLBastian that could be the turning point in the series. Not just the game......the series. With Verlander pitching Thursday.....
spot price on 14KT gold is $49.08 dwt in Tampa Bay today - crazy that gold is over $1800/ounce - remember when the real price was $300.00..
#NFL and #ESPN have as many kinks to work out as the teams -- they just flashed the "Monday Night Football" graphic...
Next person to comment below wins 4 tickets for tonight or tomorrow night's Colts game against the McAllen Thunder!
@arakha Oooh. Haha. Well unfortunately I really shouldn't watch another tonight. Although I might. But it'd be Blue which will make me
@Kales2393 those are the real Ws just ask Hank Williams the 3rd
Show em what it isRT @Trujohnson2: Love it when scouts be at our Practice.. I counted 4 today.. Broncos , Miami , Philly , && Tampa Bay ..
Another heated game tonight between NSC Minnesota and FC Tampa Bay. be sure to make your predictions! Week 23 is already up.
If ESPN has a Hank Williams "Are You Ready For Some Football?" song for tonight, I might pass out with happiness.
Think I might go to the Colts game tomorrow
Bucs play pats tonight let's go Tampa bay!
@DJBamboozle Well, he's 2nd in the AL in ERA. He has a chance at the Cy Young, though Verlander is probably ahead of him right now
In 14 minutes of Kerry Collins, the #Colts are down 17. Let's give Curtis Painter a shot in the 2nd quarter. Why not?
@LetsGoTribe Must. Get. Innings. We must pile on and decimate their bullpen tonight! Because with Verlander, they won't need it tomorrow.
Looking for something to do before the Colts tomorrow nite? Take the Circle City Tour -- $15 hop-on/hop-off access all day!
This may be a fact!! RT @RaheemBrock Curtis painter will help the colts win their first game! U heard it here first!!!
Aw what the hell Curtis Painter coming in and we give up 3rd and 18 conversion.
@linsey_g So many! Up All Night, Terra Nova, Person of Interest, American Horror Story - hot damn, it's gonna be a good year.
Curtis Painter is totally going to get lucky tonight, probably with another girl that looks just like him
@38special_ Good luck agaist Tampa Bay tonight.
Curtis Painter...we have a chance again! Can't believe Kerry Collins didn't throw us a pick-six tonight
Today in the weird, world of musical history...Hank Williams was fired from the Grand Ole Opry and told not to return until he was sober.
@HulkHogan Hulk, would you be interesting in coming on my show on ESPN 1040 Tampa Bay one Sunday to chat?
My sons were watching MTV the other night. Looked like an absolute freak show. What happened to Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, real music?
Can't wait to go to Colts game with my sweetness tonight.
RT @qbpick Tomorrow is the big cast reveal for season 13 of DWTS! Make sure you tune in to the Bachelor Pad to find out the sexy cast.
@ScoreboardSteve I gave Verlander a slight edge over CC, but after today against Boston, he is no Cy Young material.
ProudOfAllstar? Fuck yeah. Let's get it trending worldwide just like we got Allstar Weekend trending worldwide tonight!(:
Dear ESPN - you aren't fooling anyone with your "Monday Night Football" graphics... its Thursday. Just make TNF graphics. #Thanks
@TonyIPI Dead on point. U couldn't expect to sweep with Verlander pitching...now if u get lucky tomorrow, its gravy and HUGE.
@Jzclesports I might be going thursday to see the end of the Fausto Carmona era in CLE and to see Verlander, straight filthy stuff
Two good ABs by Hosmer against Verlander tonight, even if he has just a walk and flyout to show for it
The final B-Lg draft pick game is tonight on MNF (ESPN). @sfgiantsfan55 (NYJ) vs @OsunnyG (HOU). Current leader is Ken with 27 pts.

RT if you're stoked about Monday Night Football!!
Still need to watch the Pilot for Terra Nova. Maybe tomorrow...
Curtis Painter was asked in interviews today if as the lead singer of Nirvana was getting the band back together.
Love it when scouts be at our Practice.. I counted 4 today.. Broncos , Miami , Philly , && Tampa Bay ..
#Baseball Failed 2-1 Sunday evening...Remember the B bet on Boston V Tampa Bay by 18.05 Uk time Tuesday.. No Bets Today just watching Scores
Be sure to catch former Owl football player Lestar Jean on ESPN's Monday Night Football tonight at 8 p.m. with Houston. Go Owls!
Rick Porcello is not Rick Wild Thing Vaughn. I am worried the real Ubaldo is back. Good thing Verlander is tomorrow. #tigers #yikes
Austin Collie returned to Colts practice Monday after missing a few days of camp with a knee injury.

Curtis Painter would be starting on Sunday if he took like more seriously and didn't have that ridiculous haircut
If I'm reading the Twitter Trend list correctly, people are really happy that Verlander beat the Royals yesterday
Colts game tonight! Yay!
Is this on tv again? "@kugrlover: Most of Redskins starters will sit tonight vs Tampa Bay, but 1st OL will play as long as Beck..."

Yes. I'm ready for HS, college & pro. Bring it! @blueraider93: Make Monday better! We can now come home to MNF! You ready for some Football?
