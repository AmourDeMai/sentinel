@DickieV Verlander is possibly ahead of CC, more SOs better ERA, but CC will bounce back after last night's outing like he always does

hope i get to catch Monday Night Football tonight, havent got to see a game yet.....it's only preseason wk1, but feel like ive missed a lot
@wingoz even if the Steelers win I'd be worried if I'm them or a fan.  Colts say hello to Curtis Painter...it may not be so bad after all.
They figure they better get it all in tonight cause of Verlander tomorrow?  Is that it?  #Indians
Interesting visit with Terra Nova yesterday at Stoneleigh, blowing a hoolie and Voyager 2.2 wasn't moving, class tent.

Going to predict that Curtis Painter "gets it" this season, throws for 24TD and 3400 yards. #Colts trade him for a 2nd round pick. #sarcasm
@MLBastian that could be the turning point in the series. Not just the game......the series. With Verlander pitching Thursday.....
Next person to comment below wins 4 tickets for tonight or tomorrow night's Colts game against the McAllen Thunder!
@arakha Oooh. Haha. Well unfortunately I really shouldn't watch another tonight. Although I might. But it'd be Blue which will make me
@Kales2393 those are the real Ws just ask Hank Williams the 3rd
Show em what it isRT @Trujohnson2: Love it when scouts be at our Practice..  I counted 4 today..  Broncos , Miami , Philly , && Tampa Bay ..
Another heated game tonight between NSC Minnesota and FC Tampa Bay. be sure to make your predictions! Week 23 is already up.
If ESPN has a Hank Williams "Are You Ready For Some Football?" song for tonight, I might pass out with happiness.
Think I might go to the Colts game tomorrow
@DJBamboozle Well, he's 2nd in the AL in ERA. He has a chance at the Cy Young, though Verlander is probably ahead of him right now
@LetsGoTribe Must. Get. Innings.   We must pile on and decimate their bullpen tonight! Because with Verlander, they won't need it tomorrow.
This may be a fact!! RT @RaheemBrock Curtis painter will help the colts win their first game! U heard it here first!!!
Aw what the hell Curtis Painter coming in and we give up 3rd and 18 conversion.
@linsey_g So many! Up All Night, Terra Nova, Person of Interest, American Horror Story - hot damn, it's gonna be a good year.
