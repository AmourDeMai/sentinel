# IOA system currently implementing
We are implementing IOA system right now, all the codes we did are in the IOA folder.

## Approach


## How to run
Run the Main.java class with following parameters
### train
train testDataset (the file in /resources/tweets/)
### evaluation
eval testDataset (the file in /resources/tweets/)

### Examples
    "I drove a Linconl and it's a truly dream" 
    Linconl -> proper noun -> positive

    "I drove a Linconl and it was awful"
    Linconl -> proper noun -> negative
