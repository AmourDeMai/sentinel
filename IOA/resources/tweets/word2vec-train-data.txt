So pretty much im gonna believe that myt 10,000th tweet will come sometime tonight during the MNF game Jets at Texans on ESPN
Woot! So excited that I get to watch tonight's game. Go Colts!!
@DickieV Verlander is possibly ahead of CC, more SOs better ERA, but CC will bounce back after last night's outing like he always does
@MrDuncanJames great to meet the guys from Blue today at Nurburgring. A very cool bunch of guys! Looking forward to hearing them later!
The takeaway from tonight's game: the Colts' run defense was HUGE. And Curtis Painter rightfully owes us all (us especially) a big finger.

hope i get to catch Monday Night Football tonight, havent got to see a game yet.....it's only preseason wk1, but feel like ive missed a lot
@wingoz even if the Steelers win I'd be worried if I'm them or a fan. Colts say hello to Curtis Painter...it may not be so bad after all.
They figure they better get it all in tonight cause of Verlander tomorrow? Is that it? #Indians
Interesting visit with Terra Nova yesterday at Stoneleigh, blowing a hoolie and Voyager 2.2 wasn't moving, class tent.

Man,I want to go fuxs with the homies @Hdashkane @ADdaCAPO @KEN2theFOOL tonite for MNF @ the #Horn but I can't:(
Going to predict that Curtis Painter "gets it" this season, throws for 24TD and 3400 yards. #Colts trade him for a 2nd round pick. #sarcasm
@MLBastian that could be the turning point in the series. Not just the game......the series. With Verlander pitching Thursday.....
Next person to comment below wins 4 tickets for tonight or tomorrow night's Colts game against the McAllen Thunder!
@arakha Oooh. Haha. Well unfortunately I really shouldn't watch another tonight. Although I might. But it'd be Blue which will make me
@Kales2393 those are the real Ws just ask Hank Williams the 3rd
Show em what it isRT @Trujohnson2: Love it when scouts be at our Practice.. I counted 4 today.. Broncos , Miami , Philly , && Tampa Bay ..
Another heated game tonight between NSC Minnesota and FC Tampa Bay. be sure to make your predictions! Week 23 is already up.
If ESPN has a Hank Williams "Are You Ready For Some Football?" song for tonight, I might pass out with happiness.
Think I might go to the Colts game tomorrow
@DJBamboozle Well, he's 2nd in the AL in ERA. He has a chance at the Cy Young, though Verlander is probably ahead of him right now
@LetsGoTribe Must. Get. Innings. We must pile on and decimate their bullpen tonight! Because with Verlander, they won't need it tomorrow.
This may be a fact!! RT @RaheemBrock Curtis painter will help the colts win their first game! U heard it here first!!!
Aw what the hell Curtis Painter coming in and we give up 3rd and 18 conversion.
@linsey_g So many! Up All Night, Terra Nova, Person of Interest, American Horror Story - hot damn, it's gonna be a good year.
Curtis Painter is totally going to get lucky tonight, probably with another girl that looks just like him
@38special_ Good luck agaist Tampa Bay tonight.
Curtis Painter...we have a chance again! Can't believe Kerry Collins didn't throw us a pick-six tonight
Today in the weird, world of musical history...Hank Williams was fired from the Grand Ole Opry and told not to return until he was sober.

RT @qbpick Tomorrow is the big cast reveal for season 13 of DWTS! Make sure you tune in to the Bachelor Pad to find out the sexy cast.
@ScoreboardSteve I gave Verlander a slight edge over CC, but after today against Boston, he is no Cy Young material.
ProudOfAllstar? Fuck yeah. Let's get it trending worldwide just like we got Allstar Weekend trending worldwide tonight!(:
Dear ESPN - you aren't fooling anyone with your "Monday Night Football" graphics... its Thursday. Just make TNF graphics. #Thanks
